### ðŸŽ¯ *Problem Statement*

Manufacturing assembly lines often suffer from unexpected machine disruptions, leading to significant financial losses and drops in productivity. Maintenance teams traditionally operate reactively, addressing failures as they occur. This project aims to provide a proactive solution by visualizing real-time data to anticipate potential failures before they happen.

### âœ¨ *Key Features & Insights*

* *ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Uptime Monitoring:* Tracks live operational status and visualizes machine uptime percentage against set targets.
* *âš  Disruption Root Cause Analysis:* Identifies and categorizes the frequency and duration of disruptions (e.g., mechanical, electrical, software) to pinpoint recurring problems.
* *ðŸ“Š Performance Trend Analysis:* Analyzes historical data to uncover performance trends, peak failure times, and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
* [cite_start]ðŸ”§ Proactive Maintenance Alerts:** Provides data-driven insights that help schedule preventative maintenance, reducing the likelihood of unexpected breakdowns[cite: 39].
